# Pixel Sketch

Use this [in-browser sketching canvas](https://ali-hasan97.github.io/pixel-sketch/) to create some amazing pixelated art! It has several cool tools like a rainbow mode as well as the ability to darken/lighten pieces of your drawing. It's a fun little place worth spending a few minutes to play around in.

Features:
- Create a grid of any size ranging between 2x2 and 64x64.
- Draw with any color by either clicking a single cell or by dragging across multiple cells.
- Use the eraser to undo your mistakes.
- The lightening/darkening tools can be used to add texture to your drawings.
- Rainbow mode generates only the best and brightest colors to sprinkle some life onto the canvas.
- Clear the page when the drawing is beyond saving. :cry:

Pixel Sketch was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
